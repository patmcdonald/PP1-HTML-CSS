# PP1-HTML-CSS README.md file
## Initial content of this file

My plans for this website are revised.
I'm building a website for a childcare facilty in rural Ireland.
It will have information about the location, facilities, and services available for children attending.
- Creche
- Playschool
- Easter and Summer camps

I'll use cards to display this info, with potential options to link to more details on seperate pages.

A gallery of stock photos with childcare and play content.

### For layout I'm considering CSS GRID or FLEXBOX for responsive design coding. This will hopefully simplify the development process and keep my code robust and easy to maintain of required in future.

### If I use media queries for responsiveness - I'll utilised a minimum of queries to have the ensure functionality across devices and browsers.

### Sample CSS code from Code Institute 'Love Running' project - not working due to Gitpod issues
