## Initial content of this file

This will be a knitting website.
My plan is to create a website promoting knitting as an accessible activity for anyone.
I'll also emphasise how knitting is a creative and mindful practice.

I intend my design and development to be simple, balanced with a welcoming feel and usability for users.

### For layout I'm considering CSS GRID or FLEXBOX for responsive design coding. This will hopefully simplify the development process and keep my code robust and easy to maintain of required in future.

### If I use media queries for responsiveness - I'll utilised a minimum of queries to have the ensure functionality across devices and browsers.

### Sample CSS code from Code Institute 'Love Running' project - not working due to Gitpod issues
